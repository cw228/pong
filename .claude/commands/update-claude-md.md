Review our conversation and update CLAUDE.md with useful information for future sessions.

Look for:
- New patterns, conventions, or architectural decisions
- Troubleshooting discoveries (what went wrong and how it was fixed)
- New dependencies or build changes
- API gotchas or non-obvious behavior
- Updated initialization flows or component relationships

Keep entries concise. Add to existing sections where appropriate, or create new sections if needed.
